3- Select Statement

✅ Fix — Allow access temporarily for testing

You can fix this directly from your Supabase Dashboard:

Go to your project
👉 https://lnkqupiklbgvdmfnyjlj.supabase.co/project/default/editor

Navigate to:

Database → Tables → Users → Policies


Click “Enable Row Level Security” (if not already enabled).

Then add a new policy:

Policy name: Allow all for testing

Command: All

Using expression: true

Check expression: true

✅ This will allow inserts, selects, updates, and deletes for anyone holding your API key (safe for local testing only).
